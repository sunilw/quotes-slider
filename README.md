Quotes Slider Plugin
================

This is a simple WordPress plugin. It creates a Custom Post Type called 'quotes'.

A shortcode publishes all of the Quotes and presents them as a slideshow using [swiper.js](http://idangero.us/swiper/).

This is a strictly no-frills affair with minimal styling and no UI to manage options. This is kind of deliberate. The plugin can be edited to alter the slider options, with help from the swiper.js docs. I'd suggest using the jetpack CSS editor to edit styles.

The slider is called "quotes" but really the post type works like normal WordPress post. You can use it for anything. It just happens to be made with text posts in mind.
